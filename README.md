Hi there! I'm Isaac, a web developer with a degree in mathematics and a minor in computer science. I've always been interested in the intersection of technology and creativity, and I love using my skills to build useful and engaging applications.

One of my proudest projects is Vibia's Market, a web app that I built using Sveltekit and Postgres. It's designed to make shopping easier when playing DnD, and so far it's received some really positive feedback. I'm always looking for ways to improve and add new features, so if you have any ideas or suggestions, don't hesitate to let me know!

I'm also a hardware enthusiast, and I've built and written the firmware for a Kyria keyboard that I use daily for coding, gaming, and general browsing.

If you're looking for a talented and motivated web developer with a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I'd love to chat about how I can help you bring your projects to life!
