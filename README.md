Hey I´m Isaac, aka Voldari, and I´m probably reading some documentation.

I´m working on projects and trying to get foothold in the webdev world and eager to try new things and tech. I´m currently working on projects to learn the interesting world of svelte. 

I am looking for work either full time or just on something interesting to work on.

You can reach me at IsaacHarperDev@gmail.com and find my space on the web at IsaacHarper.dev
